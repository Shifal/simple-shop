@RestController → makes it a REST API controller.

@RequestMapping → sets base path.

@GetMapping, @PostMapping, etc. → define HTTP methods.

@RequestBody → automatically maps JSON → Java object.

@PathVariable → extracts {id} from URL.

ResponseEntity → allows you to set HTTP status and custom message.

Optional + orElseThrow() → safely handle “not found” cases.



| Method     | HTTP   | URL                   | Description              |
| ---------- | ------ | --------------------- | ------------------------ |
| `getAll()` | GET    | `/api/customers`      | Fetch all customers      |
| `create()` | POST   | `/api/customers`      | Create new customer      |
| `update()` | PUT    | `/api/customers/{id}` | Update existing customer |
| `delete()` | DELETE | `/api/customers/{id}` | Delete customer by ID    |



Getters and setters make your private data accessible safely.
Spring Boot, Hibernate, and Jackson all depend on them for reading/writing values between your Java objects, database, and JSON data.
