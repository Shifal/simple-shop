@RestController → makes it a REST API controller.

@RequestMapping → sets base path.

@GetMapping, @PostMapping, etc. → define HTTP methods.

@RequestBody → automatically maps JSON → Java object.

@PathVariable → extracts {id} from URL.

ResponseEntity → allows you to set HTTP status and custom message.

Optional + orElseThrow() → safely handle “not found” cases.



| Method     | HTTP   | URL                   | Description              |
| ---------- | ------ | --------------------- | ------------------------ |
| `getAll()` | GET    | `/api/customers`      | Fetch all customers      |
| `create()` | POST   | `/api/customers`      | Create new customer      |
| `update()` | PUT    | `/api/customers/{id}` | Update existing customer |
| `delete()` | DELETE | `/api/customers/{id}` | Delete customer by ID    |



Getters and setters make your private data accessible safely.
Spring Boot, Hibernate, and Jackson all depend on them for reading/writing values between your Java objects, database, and JSON data.


package com.simpleshop;
> Declares that this class belongs to the com.simpleshop package.
> Organizes the code logically — it’s like a folder structure for Java classes.

import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication;
import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication;
>SpringApplication → A helper class that bootstraps and launches a Spring app from a main() method.
>@SpringBootApplication → A convenience annotation that combines three important ones:
    > @Configuration → Marks the class as a source of bean definitions.
    > @EnableAutoConfiguration → Automatically configures Spring Boot based on dependencies (e.g., auto-configures JPA, DataSource, Jackson, etc.).
    > @ComponentScan → Scans the com.simpleshop package and sub-packages for components like:
        @Controller, @Service, @Repository, @RestController, etc.

@SpringBootApplication
public class OrderApiApplication {
> Declares your main application class.
> The name OrderApiApplication usually reflects the project’s domain — here, it’s about orders and shop functionality.

public static void main(String[] args) {
    SpringApplication.run(OrderApiApplication.class, args);
}
> This is where program starts executing.
> SpringApplication.run() does the following:
    1. Starts the Spring context (loads all beans).
    2. Launches the embedded server (Tomcat/Jetty).
    3. Runs the application lifecycle — including startup listeners, initializers, etc.
    4. Logs startup info to the console (the Spring Boot banner, port, profiles, etc.).
